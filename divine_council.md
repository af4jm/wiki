## What is a Divine Council Worldview?

by Dr. Ronn Johnson in [episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXDY0OLRspU&list=PLwfjUxja_BKcaWv3hBTWDpo0OpydSLSeq&t=1555s) of the <cite>Divine Council Worldview Podcast</cite>

1. The starting point for all biblical interpretation is an attempt to understand the original writer, his intended audience, and the culture they shared. This means, among many things, that all biblical study must use original languages.
2. The cosmology of the Bible presumes a society of divine beings who were created by one deity. This single, Most High God, is named YHWH (“Yahweh”); and He exhibits eternal, unquestioned rule over all spirits and beings.
3. At an early point within the biblical story, Yahweh delegated authoritative power to a number of created deities over the physical world (nations, etc.). Judgement is yet promised upon a number of these beings for their misuse of this authority.
4. Jesus Christ has presently assumed, by the decree of Yahweh, the place of highest honor over all gods and humans.
5. The locus of the Gospel message throughout Acts and Paul’s epistles is loyalty to Jesus/<wbr/>Yahweh above all other gods.
6. In the next age, believers will assume the status of divineness, a position which will rival, possibly replace, the ruling gods of this present age.

<small>English translation by R.H. Charles (<time>1913</time>)<!-- https://ref.ly/logosres/chaspot?ref=Pseudepigrapha.1+En --></small>

<b>7</b> <sup>1</sup> And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives, and each chose for himself one, and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them, and they taught them charms and enchantments, and the cutting of roots, and made them acquainted with plants. <sup>2</sup> And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three thousand ells: <sup>3</sup> Who consumed all the acquisitions of men. <sup>4</sup> And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. <sup>5</sup> And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another’s flesh, and drink the blood. <sup>6</sup> Then the earth laid accusation against the lawless ones.

<b>8</b> <sup>1</sup> And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures. <sup>2</sup> And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways. <sup>3</sup> Samyaza taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, Armaros the resolving of enchantments, Baraqiel astrology, Kokabiel the constellations, Chazaqiel the knowledge of the clouds, Arakiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel the course of the moon. <sup>4</sup> And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven …
